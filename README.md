# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Commerce and Arts majoring in Finance, Accounting, Economics, and Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because when asking around about people's opinions on the stage two & three stats papers,a general theme was that people had really enjoyed STATS 220; everyone I talked to had nothing but good things to say about this course and how it was taught
- I am interested in learning about HTML, the tidyverse, coding; all relatively new to me so excited to learn more!
