This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## About Me:
* I am undertaking a degree in **Commerce** and **Arts** majoring in **Finance, Accounting, Economics**, and **Statistics**
* I am taking STATS 220 because when asking around about people's opinions on the stage two & three stats papers,a general theme was that people had really enjoyed STATS 220; everyone I talked to had nothing but good things to say about this course and how it was taught
* I am interested in learning about HTML, the tidyverse, coding; all relatively new to me, so excited to learn more!

# My Learning Goals
1. Increase my confidence using R and R Studio
2. Familiarise myself with packages such as tidyverse
3. Gain hands-on experience with a broad variety of data science challenges
4. Make some cool memes!
